# Using Machine Learning to Predict Stock Prices
### Description
This project utilizes Logistric Regression, Linear Regression, KNearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, MLP, and SVC Machine Learning models to predict the stock prices of stocks. I was able to not only predict with the models, but also use pandas to sort the data and matplotlib to later plot the graphs of the model performances when predicting the prices.

**Libraries Used**: SKLearn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, LinearRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, MLPClassifier, SVC), Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy.

The data used in the program was found on Kaggle, which supplied historical stock and ETF data dating all the way up to 2017. I mention in the conclusion in the jupyter notebook that more data can be uploaded, formatted, and used to make the datasets bigger and more recent. 

### Visualization of Model Performances
Below, I have attatched the graphs that the program produces to show how the model performances stack up against each other:
